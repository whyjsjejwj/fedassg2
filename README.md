## design idea

Originally, we throught of a more complex design with descriptions and alot more words on the screen, but then during the coding phase, we realized that a typing game should be simple and easy to navigate, with minimalist design that would appeal to anyone coming onto the website instead ofone clutered with words. 
Reducing the front page that should introduce the website and what it is for, we made the whole typing game the front page, so that users will be greeted immediately with what they came for.
generally for all the pages of the website, the color theme is greyish black and white for a more professional feel and whatever functionality has it's design kept to the bare minimum to give the website a clean feeling
